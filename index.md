# Hi!
I'm Angela, a technical writer with a passion for creating amazing documentation experiences. 
{: .fs-6 : .fw-300 }

Currently, I'm a Technical Writer Intern at [Workato], where I write documentation to help enterprise customers create automated workflows and integrations. In the past, I've interned at [Splunk], writing tutorials and use cases to facilitate user adoption of Dashboard Studio. I also worked at [Argo AI], crafting documentation to support map operations for self-driving cars. I'm excited for my next technical writing opportunity and ready to take on new challenges.

I am majoring in Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, cooking new recipes, and playing video games with my friends! 

## Featured Samples
These are some samples that I'm especially proud of:
* Modify and write dynamic options syntax
* Create a dashboard
* August tech writing tidbit

## Navigation
My portfolio contains the following sections:

* Workato
