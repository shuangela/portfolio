# Hi!
I'm Angela, a technical writer with a passion for creating amazing documentation experiences. 
{: .fs-6 : .fw-300 }

I'm currently an Associate Technical Writer at [MongoDB], where I write technical documentation supporting the MongoDB drivers ecosystem. Previously, I've worked at [Workato], writing documentation to help enterprise customers create automated workflows and integrations. I've also worked at [Splunk], creating tutorials and use cases to facilitate user adoption of Dashboard Studio. My first technical writing experience was at [Argo AI], supporting map operations for self-driving cars. 

I studied Cognitive Science with a minor in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, cooking new recipes, and playing video games with my friends! 

## Featured Samples
These are some samples that I'm especially proud of:
* [Modify and write dynamic options syntax]
* [Create a dashboard]
* [August tech writing tidbit](/portfolio/August-Tidbit)

## Navigation
My portfolio contains the following sections:

* [Workato](/portfolio/Workato)
* [Splunk](/portfolio/Splunk)
* [Argo AI](/portfolio/Argo)
* [Personal Projects](/portfolio/Personal-Projects)

The navigation is on the left side of the page on computers and displays as a hamburger <img src="https://github.com/shuangela/portfolio/assets/17172489/05673d94-0fc1-4e4a-b3f5-39834f2c248a" alt="hamburger menu" width="20"/> menu on mobile devices.
