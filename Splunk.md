# Splunk
I wrote the following documentation samples as a Technical Writer Intern at Splunk. 

In addition to these samples,
I completed a technical editing project where I edited over 20 pages of user guidance for Splunk's cybersecurity software, focusing on adherence to the Splunk Style Guide and technical accuracy. 
I also responded to user feedback tickets and contributed guidance regarding proper product names to the Splunk Style Guide.

## Dashboard Studio tutorial

At Splunk, I worked on the relatively new Dashboard Studio team and worked on user enablement within Dashboard Studio. By leveraging user data, I re-focused the existing eight-page Dashboard Studio tutorial on features of the product 
that users often used. I also conducted user testing to further align the tutorial with common issues users faced.

## Dynamic Options Syntax documentation

I also created four new pieces of documentation focusing on Dynamic Options Syntax (DOS), which is a syntax that advanced Dashboard Studio creators use to dynamically update dashboards. Through this process, 
I worked closely with Product Managers and Software Engineers to document the technical specifications of DOS and guide users through common DOS use cases.
