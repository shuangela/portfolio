# Workato

As a Technical Writer Intern at Workato, I worked on documentation content related to Workato connectors and recipe design. My main duties were editing and updating out-of-date documentation for both technical accuracy and stylistic accuracy.

Although I mostly maintained and revised documentation, I created the following documentation about the FileStorage UI from the ground up.
