# Personal Projects

In my spare time, I enjoy creating my own pieces of work to help friends and family.

## Introduction to Discord
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to create a family Discord server, but my family did not know what Discord was. To help them learn how to use Discord, I wrote the following guide.

## Vale Linter quick start guide

Vale Linter is a tool for linting documentation. I wrote this guide for my friend who wanted to use Vale to lint her English essays.

## Asteroid Adventure

Aside from documentation, I also dabble in programming. To challenge myself, I made an interactive browser-based Javascript game using the p5play library. In this endless runner platform game, you pilot a spaceship and avoid randomly generated asteroids. 

Although this project is not documentation, it demonstrates my technical abilities and love of learning new technical skills.
