# Argo AI
At Argo AI, I focused on two projects: revamping the style guide, and updating internal map documentation to support map analysts. Both projects were under NDA and I cannot share samples. 

I also wrote an email sent out to more than 2000 employees about the new updates to the style guide. The email was part of a monthly update series by the technical writing team, where we educated
employees on tech writing tips and tricks. I've shared the email below as an example of my internal communications skills.
